 VARIABLE ISTOP HAS BEEN RETURNED WITH A NONZERO VALUE  
 FROM USER SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE FCN.  THIS OCCURRED DURING
 THE COMPUTATION OF THE NUMBER OF RELIABLE DIGITS IN THE 
 PREDICTED VALUES (F) RETURNED FROM SUBROUTINE FCN, INDI-
 CATING THAT CHANGES IN THE INITIAL ESTIMATES OF BETA(K),
 K=1,NP, AS SMALL AS 2*BETA(K)*SQRT(MACHINE PRECISION),  
 WHERE MACHINE PRECISION IS DEFINED AS THE SMALLEST VALUE
 E SUCH THAT 1+E>1 ON THE COMPUTER BEING USED, PREVENT   
 SUBROUTINE FCN FROM BEING PROPERLY EVALUATED.  THE      
 INITIAL ESTIMATES MUST BE ADJUSTED TO ALLOW PROPER      
 EVALUATION OF SUBROUTINE FCN DURING THESE COMPUTATIONS  
 BEFORE THE REGRESSION PROCEDURE CAN CONTINUE.
