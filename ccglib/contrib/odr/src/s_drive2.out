                       A=0 ==> FIT IS NOT A RESTART.
                       B=0 ==> DELTAS ARE INITIALIZED TO ZERO.
                       C=0 ==> COVARIANCE MATRIX WILL BE COMPUTED USING
                               DERIVATIVES RE-EVALUATED AT THE SOLUTION.
                       D=0 ==> DERIVATIVES ARE ESTIMATED BY FORWARD DIFFERENCES.
                       E=1 ==> METHOD IS IMPLICIT ODR.
